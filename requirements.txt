# Core ML Libraries
#torch>=1.13.1 #Already installed and loaded as a module

# Hugging Face Ecosystem
transformers>=4.35.0  # Core library for models, tokenizers, trainer
datasets>=2.14.0     # For data loading and processing
peft>=0.7.0         # For LoRA / Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
accelerate>=0.25.0   # Simplifies distributed training & mixed precision

# Distributed Training & Optimization
deepspeed>=0.12.0     # For ZeRO optimization / distributed training

# Notes:
# 1. Ensure the base PyTorch version (e.g., 1.13.1) is compatible with the loaded HPC module and its CUDA version.
# 2. This file specifies minimum versions. Pip will install the latest available versions satisfying these constraints.
#    This may lead to newer versions than tested.
# 3. Install using: pip install -r requirements.txt
